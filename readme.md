# :smiley_cat: Muhammad Nabiel Setiawan

I am Muhammad Nabiel Setiawan, a fresh graduate in Information Systems from Telkom University, graduating with a GPA of 3.66/4.00 (cum laude). I have expertise in mobile, web, and full-stack development. My skills also include working with databases.

I have earned several certifications from Dicoding, covering topics in Android Development, Web Development, SQL, and Version Control.

During my time at university, I worked as a Practicum Assistant, teaching mobile app development, database design, and programming while helping students solve practical challenges. I also participated in Bangkit Academyâ€™s Android Learning Path, where I led a team in completing an Android app using Jetpack Compose for the Capstone Project.

Some of my notable projects include StockMobile, an Android stock management app featuring barcode scanning and Google Maps integration; NotesApp, a React Native-based note-taking app with Firebase CRUD functionality; and GinsengStrip, an e-commerce website built with Laravel for managing products and transactions.
